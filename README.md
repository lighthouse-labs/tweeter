a# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

A twitter clone by Lighthouse Labs for web bootcamp students to learn front-end dev skill to practice their front-end skills using:
- HTML,
- CSS,
- JS,
- jQuery, and 
- AJAX.
The project will also continue practice back-end skills using their Node, Express and MongoDB knowledge.

This repository is the starter code for the project: fork and clone this git repository, then build upon it to practice front-end skills mentioned above including utilizing back-end skills learned last week.

We were also challenged to adapt different CSS methods to visualize and build the two-dimensional site.  Along the way we also learned theory and practical solutions to common security concerns with front-end development.
